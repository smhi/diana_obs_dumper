filewatcher - Version 1.0.0
Sends signals using coserver4 when the contents of a directory has changed, or a file of specified type has changed in some way.

Description
===========
The filewatcher uses stat and QDir to poll directories or files for changedes. The application is threaded and only one directory or file type is handled by each thread. When a thread discovers a change, it sends an signal by the Qt signal and slot mechanism and the receiving Qt object formats a message and sends it to the coserver4.
The coserver4 distributes it to the diana instanses that are connected to the coserver4.
It should be possible to modify tseries so it could also use signals from filewatcher.

Command line arguments
======================
Example:

./filewatcher -v -w '/data/prod/diana/datadir/obs/*.lp2,/data/prod/diana/datadir/satellit,/data/prodtest/diana/server/datadir/radar' -c '/data/proj/diana/NYVIS_DEV/Yngve.Einarsson/DIANA/linda/local/src/coserver4/bin/coserver4 -v & ' &

-v tells filewatcher to show a user interface in the same way as coserver4 does.
-w is the directories/file types to watch
-c is the path to coserver4

NOTE the format *.lp2. The allowed format is the same as glob or QDir can handle. filewatcher is implemeted so it should always watch the youngest file with extension *.lp2 or whatever on the actual directory.


Requirements
============
Qt 4.8 or later. Thread support in Qt.
miLogger,puTools,qUtilities and coserver.
